# Ark Engrams Override
 Tool to make 'Game.ini' entries for overriding engram settings. Tools are great!
 
Visual Studio 2019, Community

Setup to use a local MSSQL database. You can change the 'DBConn' string in Properties\Settings.

Changes could be made to work from an xml file, since DataSet supports it.

Sql files included in Properties to create tables and data:
*	Engrams table and data
*	EngramCategories table and data

Database name is **ARK**. There is no auto-increment on the primary keys.

To accept changes, you -have- to hit the 'Save Changes' button, by design.

Could be modified to update when you end a row edit.

I created categories to make filtering the engrams easier. It has no bearing on the game.

List of categories:
* Addons  (Chair, Bench, etc.)
* Ammo
* Attatchments
* Beds
* Boots
* Catwalks
* Ceilings
* Container
* Crafting Station
* Doorframes
